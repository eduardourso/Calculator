# Calculator

The goal of this project is to reproduce the calculator app in the iTunes U `Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift`course provided by Stanford University during my `Novoda Craftmanship University`(NCU).

The calculator is a RPL (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator, where numbers are entered first then operations. 

i.e. 3 + 5:

```
3 Enter, 5 Enter, + 
or 3 Enter, 5 +
```

Another goal is to impletent this app using `MVVM` as a design pattern and `RxSwift` as a library for composing asynchronous code by using observable sequences.
